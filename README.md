# Data-Science-Project-2
# Movie Recommendation
This project is a part of my Internship provided by Acmegrade.

#### -- Project Status: Completed

## Project Intro/Objective

The objective of this data science project is to develop a personalized movie recommendation system that enhances user experience by suggesting films tailored to individual preferences. Leveraging collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and using cosine similarity technique, the project will analyze user ratings, movie attributes, and viewing history. The goal is to create an accurate and efficient recommendation engine that predicts and recommends movies users are likely to enjoy, thereby increasing user engagement and satisfaction on streaming platforms "(we used director name and movie name to recommend next movies)". 

### Methods Used
* cosine similarity  
* Predictive Modeling
* Data Visualization

### Technologies

* Python
* matplotlib
* sklearn
* Pandas, jupyter
* Numpy

## Project Description
This project aims to build a sophisticated movie recommendation system using data science techniques. By analyzing user ratings, movie metadata, and viewing history, we employ collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and cosine similarity to predict and suggest movies that align with individual preferences. The process includes data preprocessing, feature extraction, and model training. The resulting system will provide personalized recommendations, enhancing user experience and engagement on streaming platforms. Our approach seeks to improve recommendation accuracy and user satisfaction by tailoring suggestions to specific tastes and viewing habits.

## Needs of this project

- Personalization
- Movie Discovery
- Engagements

Ultimately, the project aims to improve user satisfaction and platform loyalty by providing more relevant and enjoyable movie recommendations.
